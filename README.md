# Automated Game Playing Bot

Using Python and Selenium Webdriver I created bot who play online game under the link: https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/ . Bot is clicking a cookie for 5 minutes. Every 5 seconds it is checking for available upgrades and it is buying most expensive one. After 5 minutes it print scores of game (how many cookies produces per second).
